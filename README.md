## How to play
### Rahman the tennis player
There's 2 endpoint for this solution
|endpoint  |method|description|
|----------|------|-----------|
|/api/container|GET|get list of Rahman's ball container|
|/api/container/put|POST|put ball to one of Rahman's ball container|

### Mom's Kitara Store
There's 4 endpoint for this solution
|endpoint  |method|description|
|----------|------|-----------|
|/api/product|GET|get list of products|
|/api/product/{id}/pessimisticOrder|POST|order product with pessimistic approach to avoid race condition|
|/api/product/{id}/optimisticOrder|POST|order product with optimistic approach to avoid race condition|
|/api/order|GET|get list of orders|

There's 2 approach I am implemeted to handling race condition when many order occurred for same product at a time.

1. Pessimistic Locking Approach
   
   The pessimistic locking approach is that the system assumes the worst, i.e., the updates always occur at the same time. Thus, it eliminates the race condition by locking the record. Pessimist systems typically rely on the database locking facilities; for example InnoDBâ€™s row-level lock.

2. Optimistic Locking Approach
   
   The Optimistic locking approach is the the system assumes that although race conditions may occur, they are very rare. Therefore, instead of locking the record on every access, it looks for indications which denote the clients actually did try to update the record at the same time.

3. Async Approach
   
   There other approach I am not implemetent here. Async approach is the system will queueing the order requests. Below is sequence diagram to do this approach.
